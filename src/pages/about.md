Hi there, Iâ€™m Joshua Plagerman and I am a Senior Graphic/UX Designer at Eastern Washington University. I have always loved the problem solving aspect of the UX world and mended it together with my love for art and design.

I am always looking at the world through a critical eye, pointing out flaws or ways things can change or tweaked for the everyday person. When I am not being a critic, I usually spend my time on my guitar, improvising rifts or trying to be like some of my favorite artists. I am hardworking, passionate, dedicated and very self motivated to be the best possible version of myself I can be.

I have many years of experience designing yearbooks, their pages and layouts and covers for books. I also love designing interfaces for web pages and apps, using many different platforms to get the job done. In the future, I plan on combining my passion for music and art into a job that appeases both aspects.
