This project was one of my favorites since it combined two of my biggest passions, music and design. For this project, I researched into guitar amps and why some people like certain brands and why some people don’t. I wanted to figure out if there was the “perfect” amp out there on the market. I compared features, the overall design, what was on the amp and the guitar communities overall opinions about the amps.With the use of all that information I found, I used it to create a lo-fi mockup of and amp. I recieved feedback from classmates which I then used to create a hi-fi concept of the amp. I did this project because in the guitar wold, there are many differing opinions based around amps, what brands are the best, and the features an amp should have built into it. My goal was to take all of that information and create the “perfect” amp for the players.
