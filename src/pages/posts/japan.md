I was inspired to do this because of the calamity of this most recent election. Regardless of where you stand on the political spectrum, this was a very critical election. I decided to use digital oil paints to convey a messy message since that is how this election felt. I also wanted to send a message of haste, like drop you ice cream mid lick and go and vote kinda haste!
