I made this poster for the Women Helping Women Fund in Spokane. The intent behind the poster was to show the dangers of stress on a womens pregnancy and how it can affect the child while it is in the womb. My thoughs behind the poster was to show how balance (yoga in this case) can create a sense of security and calm throughout the pregnancy and help create a better experince for both the child and the mother.
