This was a project I really enjoyed doing for Google, making a welcome screen for National Guitar Day. This is an animated SVG that I coded myself and helped create with Adobe Illustraitor and brought to life using GSAP. I made/tested multiple different animation techniques to achieve my goal. I really enjoy coding and I used a plug-in that I was not too familiar with but was able to blend it with my knowledge of Java Script to make it work. I used Github to store my work and used Netlify to deploy it.
