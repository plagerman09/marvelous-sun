For this project, I looked at the current Xbox Home Screen and thought it could look a lot better. The placement of the icons and what was avaliable on the home screen was very random and sporadic. I asked some buddies (who all play Xbox) and got their opinion abour what they would want to see if the home screen was changed. I weighed in their opinions when it came to my original concepts and had them give feedback on those early designs. I ended up with an interactive Figma Prototype of what the new homw screen would look like and how it would function on an Xbox.
