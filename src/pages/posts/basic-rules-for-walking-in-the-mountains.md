For this book cover, I wanted to work with negative space and using it to create a figure out of well... negative space. My goal was to make the map of Mordor and create a hand out of the mountains surrounding Mt. Doom that looked like it was reaching for the ring at the top of the page!

I have seen these movies too many times to count but suprisingly I have never ended up reading the books but I am sure that will change soon.
